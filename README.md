## Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with daily outfit decisions, often influenced by factors like mood, weather, and personal style. Current fashion recommendation systems often lack personalization and emotional intelligence.

---

## Project Overview

**Clozify** is a mobile application designed to recommend daily outfits that align with the user's mood and weather conditions. The app uses **machine learning** to detect facial expressions, classifying the user's emotional state, and then suggests outfits based on both their mood and the current weather. This approach provides personalized, practical, and mindful dressing solutions, enhancing user satisfaction while promoting emotional well-being.

---

## Key Features

- **Mood Detection**: Utilizes facial expression analysis to recognize the user's mood through machine learning.
- **Weather Integration**: Incorporates real-time weather data to suggest weather-appropriate clothing.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Outfits are recommended based on both the user's mood and weather conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive mobile interface for submitting mood, weather, and receiving outfit suggestions.
- **Cloud Integration**: Real-time synchronization and storage using cloud services, providing reliable backend support for the app.
